the ReadOnly (and this is invalid, at least in Modelsim).

    """
    The main scheduler.

    Here we accept callbacks from the simulator and schedule the appropriate
    coroutines.

    A callback fires, causing the `react`_ method to be called, with the
    trigger that caused the callback as the first argument.

    We look up a list of coroutines to schedule (indexed by the trigger) and
    schedule them in turn. NB implementors should not depend on the scheduling
    order!

    Some additional management is required since coroutines can return a list
    of triggers, to be scheduled when any one of the triggers fires.  To
    ensure we don't receive spurious callbacks, we have to un-prime all the
    other triggers when any one fires.

    Due to the simulator nuances and fun with delta delays we have the
    following modes:

    Normal mode
        - Callbacks cause coroutines to be scheduled
        - Any pending writes are cached and do not happen immediately

    ReadOnly mode
        - Corresponds to cbReadOnlySynch (VPI) or vhpiCbLastKnownDeltaCycle
          (VHPI).  In this state we are not allowed to perform writes.

    Write mode
        - Corresponds to cbReadWriteSynch (VPI) or vhpiCbEndOfProcesses (VHPI)
          In this mode we play back all the cached write updates.

    We can legally transition from normal->write by registering a ReadWrite
    callback, however usually once a simulator has entered the ReadOnly phase
    of a given timestep then we must move to a new timestep before performing
    any writes.  The mechanism for moving to a new timestep may not be
    consistent across simulators and therefore we provide an abstraction to
    assist with compatibility.


    Unless a coroutine has explicitly requested to be scheduled in ReadOnly
    mode (for example wanting to sample the finally settled value after all
    delta delays) then it can reasonably be expected to be scheduled during
    "normal mode" i.e. where writes are permitted.
