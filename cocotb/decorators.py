    Decorator to mark a Callable which returns a Coroutine as a test.

    The test decorator provides a test timeout, and allows us to mark tests as skipped
    or expecting errors or failures.
    Tests are evaluated in the order they are defined in a test module.

    Used as ``@cocotb.test(...)``.

    Args:
        timeout_time (numbers.Real or decimal.Decimal, optional):
            Simulation time duration before timeout occurs.

            .. versionadded:: 1.3

            .. note::
                Test timeout is intended for protection against deadlock.
                Users should use :class:`~cocotb.triggers.with_timeout` if they require a
                more general-purpose timeout mechanism.

        timeout_unit (str, optional):
            Units of timeout_time, accepts any units that :class:`~cocotb.triggers.Timer` does.

            .. versionadded:: 1.3

            .. deprecated:: 1.5
                Using ``None`` as the *timeout_unit* argument is deprecated, use ``'step'`` instead.

        expect_fail (bool, optional):
            If ``True`` and the test fails a functional check via an ``assert`` statement, :class:`pytest.raises`,
            :class:`pytest.warns`, or :class:`pytest.deprecated_call` the test is considered to have passed.
            If ``True`` and the test passes successfully, the test is considered to have failed.

        expect_error (exception type or tuple of exception types, optional):
            Mark the result as a pass only if one of the exception types is raised in the test.
            This is primarily for cocotb internal regression use for when a simulator error is expected.

            Users are encouraged to use the following idiom instead::

                @cocotb.test()
                async def my_test(dut):
                    try:

                    else:
                        assert False, "Exception did not occur"

            .. versionchanged:: 1.3
                Specific exception types can be expected

            .. deprecated:: 1.5
                Passing a :class:`bool` value is now deprecated.
                Pass a specific :class:`Exception` or a tuple of Exceptions instead.

        skip (bool, optional):
            Don't execute this test as part of the regression. Test can still be run
            manually by setting :make:var:`TESTCASE`.

        stage (int)
            Order tests logically into stages, where multiple tests can share a stage.
            Defaults to 0.
