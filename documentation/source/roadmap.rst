cocotb is in active development.

We use GitHub issues to track our pending tasks.
Take a look at the `open Feature List <https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atype%3Afeature>`_ to see the work that's lined up.

If you have a GitHub account you can also `raise an enhancement request <https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/issues/new>`_ to suggest new features.
