This page documents any known quirks and gotchas in the various simulators.


.. _sim-icarus:

Icarus
======

.. _sim-icarus-accessing-bits:

Accessing bits in a vector
--------------------------

Accessing bits of a vector doesn't work:

.. code-block:: python3

    dut.stream_in_data[2] <= 1

See ``access_single_bit`` test in :file:`examples/functionality/tests/test_discovery.py`.

.. _sim-icarus-waveforms:

Waveforms
---------

To get waveforms in VCD format some Verilog code must be added
to the top component as shown in the example below:

.. code-block:: verilog

    module button_deb(
        input  clk,
        input  rst,
        input  button_in,
        output button_valid);

    //... Verilog module code here

    // the "macro" to dump signals
    `ifdef COCOTB_SIM
    initial begin
      $dumpfile ("button_deb.vcd");
      $dumpvars (0, button_deb);
      #1;
    end
    `endif
    endmodule

.. _sim-icarus-time:

Time unit and precision
-----------------------

Setting the time unit and time precision is not possible from the command-line,
and therefore make variables :make:var:`COCOTB_HDL_TIMEUNIT` and :make:var:`COCOTB_HDL_TIMEPRECISION` are ignored.


.. _sim-verilator:

Verilator
=========

cocotb supports Verilator 4.020 and above.
Verilator converts Verilog code to C++ code that is compiled.
It does not support VHDL.
One major limitation compared to standard Verilog simulators is that it does not support delayed assignments.

To run cocotb with Verilator, you need ``verilator`` in your PATH.

Finally, cocotb currently generates a Verilator toplevel C++ simulation loop which is timed at the highest precision.
If your design's clocks vary in precision, the performance of the simulation can be improved in the same order of magnitude by adjusting the precision in the Makefile, e.g.,

.. code-block:: makefile

    COCOTB_HDL_TIMEPRECISION = 1us # Set precision to 10^-6s

.. versionadded:: 1.3


.. _sim-vcs:

Synopsys VCS
============


.. _sim-aldec:

Aldec Riviera-PRO
=================

The :envvar:`LICENSE_QUEUE` environment variable can be used for this simulator –
this setting will be mirrored in the TCL ``license_queue`` variable to control runtime license checkouts.


.. _sim-questa:

Mentor Questa
=============



.. _sim-modelsim:

Mentor ModelSim
===============

Any ModelSim PE or ModelSim PE derivative (like ModelSim Microsemi, Intel, Lattice Edition) does not support the VHDL FLI feature.
If you try to run with FLI enabled, you will see a ``vsim-FLI-3155`` error:

.. code-block:: bash

    ** Error (suppressible): (vsim-FLI-3155) The FLI is not enabled in this version of ModelSim.

ModelSim DE and SE (and Questa, of course) supports the FLI.


.. _sim-incisive:

Cadence Incisive
================


.. _sim-xcelium:

Cadence Xcelium
===============


.. _sim-ghdl:

GHDL
====

Support is preliminary.
Noteworthy is that despite GHDL being a VHDL simulator, it implements the VPI interface.
