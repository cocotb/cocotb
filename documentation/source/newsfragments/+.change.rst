Changed platform support: Added Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL) and compatible clones, added macOS 13 x86_64 (Ventura on Intel), removed Ubuntu 18.04 (end-of-life). Note that Python wheels compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 remain available for the time being. Even though the cocotb project does not provide pre-compiled binaries for unsupported platforms users can typically compile cocotb themselves, as done automatically when running ``pip install``.
