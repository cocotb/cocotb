Cocotb now supports deposit/force/release/freeze actions on simulator handles, exposing functionality similar to the respective Verilog/VHDL assignments.

.. code-block:: python3

   from cocotb.handle import Deposit, Force, Release, Freeze

   dut.q <= 1            # A regular value deposit
   dut.q <= Deposit(1)   # The same, higher verbosity
   dut.q <= Force(1)     # Force value of q to 1
   dut.q <= Release()    # Release q from a Force
   dut.q <= Freeze()     # Freeze the current value of q
