The cocotb log configuration is now less intrusive, and only configures the root logger instance, ``logging.getLogger()``, as part of :func:`cocotb.log.default_config` (:pr:`1266`).

As such, it is now possible to override the default cocotb logging behavior with something like::

    # remove the cocotb log handler and formatting
    root = logging.getLogger()
    for h in root.handlers[:]:
        root.remove_handler(h)
        h.close()

    # add your own
    logging.basicConfig()
