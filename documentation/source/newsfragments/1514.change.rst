Various binary representations have changed type from :class:`str` to :class:`bytes`. These include:

* :attr:`cocotb.binary.BinaryValue.buff`, which as a consequence means :meth:`cocotb.binary.BinaryValue.assign` no longer accepts malformed ``10xz``-style :class:`str`\ s (which were treated as binary).
* The packets produced by the :class:`~cocotb.drivers.avalon.AvalonSTPkts`.

Code working with these objects may find it needs to switch from creating :class:`str` objects like ``"this"`` to :class:`bytes` objects like ``b"this"``.
This change is a consequence of the move to Python 3.
