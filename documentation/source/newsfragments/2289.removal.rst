The bus and testbenching components in cocotb have been officially moved to the `cocotb-bus <https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb-bus>`_ package.
This includes
:class:`~cocotb_bus.bus.Bus`,
:class:`~cocotb_bus.scoreboard.Scoreboard`,
everything in :mod:`cocotb_bus.drivers <cocotb.drivers>`,
and everything in :mod:`cocotb_bus.monitors <cocotb.monitors>`.
Documentation will remain in the main cocotb repo for now.
Old names will continue to exist, but their use will cause a :class:`DeprecationWarning`,
and will be removed in the future.
