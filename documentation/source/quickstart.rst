Installing cocotb
=================

Installation of Pre-requisites
------------------------------

Cocotb has the following requirements:

* Python 3.5+
* Python-dev packages
* GCC 4.8.1+ or Clang 3.3+ and associated development packages
* GNU Make
* A Verilog or VHDL simulator, depending on your RTL source code

.. versionchanged:: 1.4 Dropped Python 2 support

.. note:: In order to use a 32-bit simulator you need to use a 32-bit version of Python.

Installation with conda (all OS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Conda <https://conda.io/>`_ is an open-source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Download and install `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ from https://conda.io/ for your OS and architecture.

You will also need to install a compiler (GCC or Clang) and GNU Make.

On Windows you can easily do this with conda:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c msys2 m2-base m2-make m2w64-toolchain libpython

Native Installation for Debian/Ubuntu-based Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install make gcc g++ python3 python3-dev python3-pip
    sudo apt-get install swig  # optional, needed for one of the examples

Native Installation for Red Hat-based Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo yum install make gcc gcc-c++ libstdc++-devel python3 python3-devel python3-pip
    sudo yum install swig  # optional, needed for one of the examples

Installation for macOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need a few packages installed to get cocotb running on macOS.
Installing a package manager really helps things out here.

`Brew <https://brew.sh/>`_ seems to be the most popular, so we'll assume you have that installed.

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install python icarus-verilog gtkwave

.. seealso::

   For more installation options (also for 32-bit) please see `our Wiki <https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/wiki/Tier-2-Setup-Instructions>`_.


Simulator Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For detailed instructions and the list of supported simulators see :ref:`simulator-support`.

.. note::

    Ensure that path to the simulator executable is appended to the ``PATH`` environment variable.


.. _installation_via_pip::

Cocotb Installation via PIP
---------------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.2

Cocotb can be installed by running

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cocotb

.. seealso::

    For user-local installation, follow the `pip User Guide <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs/>`_.

To install the development version of cocotb:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/archive/master.zip

.. warning::

    ``pip`` may belong to a different python installation to what you expect.
    Use ``pip -V`` to check.
    If this shows Python 2.7, use ``pip3`` or ``python3 -m pip`` in place of ``pip`` in the commands below.

.. note::

    After installation, you should be able to execute ``cocotb-config``.
    If it is not found, you need to append its location to the ``PATH`` environment variable.
    This may happen when you use the ``--user`` option to ``pip``, in which case the location is documented :ref:`here <python:inst-alt-install-user>`.


Running your first Example
==========================

Assuming you have installed the prerequisites as above,
the following lines are all you need to run a first simulation with cocotb:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb
    cd cocotb/examples/endian_swapper/tests
    make

Selecting a different simulator is as easy as:

.. code-block:: bash

    make SIM=vcs


Running the same example as VHDL
--------------------------------

The ``endian_swapper`` example includes both a VHDL and a Verilog RTL implementation.
The cocotb testbench can execute against either implementation using VPI for
Verilog and VHPI/FLI for VHDL.  To run the test suite against the VHDL
implementation use the following command (a VHPI or FLI capable simulator must
be used):

.. code-block:: bash

    make SIM=ghdl TOPLEVEL_LANG=vhdl


Using cocotb
============

A typical cocotb testbench requires no additional HDL code (though nothing prevents you from adding testbench helper code).
The Design Under Test (DUT) is instantiated as the toplevel in the simulator
without any wrapper code.
Cocotb drives stimulus onto the inputs to the DUT and monitors the outputs
directly from Python.


Creating a Makefile
-------------------

To create a cocotb test we typically have to create a Makefile.  Cocotb provides
rules which make it easy to get started.  We simply inform cocotb of the
source files we need compiling, the toplevel entity to instantiate and the
Python test script to load.

.. code-block:: makefile

    VERILOG_SOURCES = $(PWD)/submodule.sv $(PWD)/my_design.sv
    # TOPLEVEL is the name of the toplevel module in your Verilog or VHDL file:
    TOPLEVEL=my_design
    # MODULE is the name of the Python test file:
    MODULE=test_my_design

    include $(shell cocotb-config --makefiles)/Makefile.sim

We would then create a file called ``test_my_design.py`` containing our tests.


Creating a test
---------------

The test is written in Python. Cocotb wraps your top level with the handle you
pass it. In this documentation, and most of the examples in the project, that
handle is ``dut``, but you can pass your own preferred name in instead. The
handle is used in all Python files referencing your RTL project. Assuming we
have a toplevel port called ``clk`` we could create a test file containing the
following:

.. code-block:: python3

    import cocotb
    from cocotb.triggers import Timer

    @cocotb.test()
    def my_first_test(dut):
        """Try accessing the design."""

        dut._log.info("Running test!")
        for cycle in range(10):
            dut.clk = 0
            yield Timer(1, units='ns')
            dut.clk = 1
            yield Timer(1, units='ns')
        dut._log.info("Running test!")

This will drive a square wave clock onto the ``clk`` port of the toplevel.


Accessing the design
--------------------

When cocotb initializes it finds the top-level instantiation in the simulator
and creates a handle called ``dut``. Top-level signals can be accessed using the
"dot" notation used for accessing object attributes in Python. The same mechanism
can be used to access signals inside the design.

.. code-block:: python3

    # Get a reference to the "clk" signal on the top-level
    clk = dut.clk

    # Get a reference to a register "count"
    # in a sub-block "inst_sub_block"
    count = dut.inst_sub_block.count


Assigning values to signals
---------------------------

Values can be assigned to signals using either the
:attr:`~cocotb.handle.NonHierarchyObject.value` property of a handle object
or using direct assignment while traversing the hierarchy.

.. code-block:: python3

    # Get a reference to the "clk" signal and assign a value
    clk = dut.clk
    clk.value = 1

    # Direct assignment through the hierarchy
    dut.input_signal <= 12

    # Assign a value to a memory deep in the hierarchy
    dut.sub_block.memory.array[4] <= 2


The syntax ``sig <= new_value`` is a short form of ``sig.value = new_value``.
It not only resembles HDL syntax, but also has the same semantics:
writes are not applied immediately, but delayed until the next write cycle.
Use ``sig.setimmediatevalue(new_val)`` to set a new value immediately
(see :meth:`~cocotb.handle.ModifiableObject.setimmediatevalue`).

In addition to regular value assignments (deposits), signals can be forced
to a predetermined value or frozen at their current value. To achieve this,
the various actions described in :ref:`assignment-methods` can be used.

.. code-block:: python3

    # Deposit action
    dut.my_signal <= 12
    dut.my_signal <= Deposit(12)  # equivalent syntax

    # Force action
    dut.my_signal <= Force(12)    # my_signal stays 12 until released

    # Release action
    dut.my_signal <= Release()    # Reverts any force/freeze assignments

    # Freeze action
    dut.my_signal <= Freeze()     # my_signal stays at current value until released


Reading values from signals
---------------------------

Accessing the :attr:`~cocotb.handle.NonHierarchyObject.value` property of a handle object will return a :any:`BinaryValue` object.
Any unresolved bits are preserved and can be accessed using the :attr:`~cocotb.binary.BinaryValue.binstr` attribute,
or a resolved integer value can be accessed using the :attr:`~cocotb.binary.BinaryValue.integer` attribute.

.. code-block:: python3

    >>> # Read a value back from the DUT
    >>> count = dut.counter.value
    >>>
    >>> print(count.binstr)
    1X1010
    >>> # Resolve the value to an integer (X or Z treated as 0)
    >>> print(count.integer)
    42
    >>> # Show number of bits in a value
    >>> print(count.n_bits)
    6

We can also cast the signal handle directly to an integer:

.. code-block:: python3

    >>> print(int(dut.counter))
    42



Parallel and sequential execution
---------------------------------

An :keyword:`await` will run an :keyword:`async` coroutine and wait for it to complete.
The called coroutine "blocks" the execution of the current coroutine.
Wrapping the call in :func:`~cocotb.fork` runs the coroutine concurrently, allowing the current coroutine to continue executing.
At any time you can :keyword:`await` the result of the forked coroutine, which will block until the forked coroutine finishes.

The following example shows these in action:

.. code-block:: python3

    async def reset_dut(reset_n, duration_ns):
        reset_n <= 0
        await Timer(duration_ns, units='ns')
        reset_n <= 1
        reset_n._log.debug("Reset complete")

    @cocotb.test()
    async def parallel_example(dut):
        reset_n = dut.reset

        # Execution will block until reset_dut has completed
        await reset_dut(reset_n, 500)
        dut._log.debug("After reset")

        # Run reset_dut concurrently
        reset_thread = cocotb.fork(reset_dut(reset_n, duration_ns=500))

        # This timer will complete before the timer in the concurrently executing "reset_thread"
        await Timer(250, units='ns')
        dut._log.debug("During reset (reset_n = %s)" % reset_n.value)

        # Wait for the other thread to complete
        await reset_thread
        dut._log.debug("After reset")

See :ref:`coroutines` for more examples of what can be done with coroutines.
