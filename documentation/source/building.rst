Build options and Environment Variables
#######################################

Make System
===========

Makefiles are provided for a variety of simulators in :file:`cocotb/share/makefiles/simulators`.
The common Makefile :file:`cocotb/share/makefiles/Makefile.sim` includes the appropriate simulator Makefile based on the contents of the ``SIM`` variable.

Make Targets
------------

Makefiles define two targets, ``regression`` and ``sim``, the default target is ``sim``.

Both rules create a results file with the name taken from :envvar:`COCOTB_RESULTS_FILE`, defaulting to ``results.xml``.  This file is a JUnit-compatible output file suitable for use with `Jenkins <https://jenkins.io/>`_. The ``sim`` targets unconditionally re-runs the simulator whereas the ``regression`` target only re-builds if any dependencies have changed.

Make Phases
-----------

Typically the makefiles provided with cocotb for various simulators use a separate ``compile`` and ``run`` target.  This allows for a rapid re-running of a simulator if none of the RTL source files have changed and therefore the simulator does not need to recompile the RTL.



Make Variables
--------------

.. make:var:: GUI

      Set this to 1 to enable the GUI mode in the simulator (if supported).

.. make:var:: SIM

      Selects which simulator Makefile to use.  Attempts to include a simulator specific makefile from :file:`cocotb/share/makefiles/simulators/makefile.$(SIM)`

.. make:var:: WAVES

      Set this to 1Â to enable wave traces dump for the Aldec Riviera-PRO and Mentor Graphics Questa simulators.
      To get wave traces in Icarus Verilog see :ref:`Simulator Support`.

.. make:var:: VERILOG_SOURCES

      A list of the Verilog source files to include.

.. make:var:: VHDL_SOURCES

      A list of the VHDL source files to include.

.. make:var:: VHDL_SOURCES_<lib>

      A list of the VHDL source files to include in the VHDL library *lib* (currently for the GHDL simulator only).

.. make:var:: COMPILE_ARGS

      Any arguments or flags to pass to the compile stage of the simulation.

.. make:var:: SIM_ARGS

      Any arguments or flags to pass to the execution of the compiled simulation.

.. make:var:: EXTRA_ARGS

      Passed to both the compile and execute phases of simulators with two rules, or passed to the single compile and run command for simulators which don't have a distinct compilation stage.

.. make:var:: PLUSARGS

      "Plusargs" are options that are starting with a plus (``+``) sign.
      They are passed to the simulator and are also available within cocotb as :data:`cocotb.plusargs`.
      In the simulator, they can be read by the Verilog/SystemVerilog system functions
      ``$test$plusargs`` and ``$value$plusargs``.

      The special plusargs ``+ntb_random_seed`` and ``+seed``, if present, are evaluated
      to set the random seed value if :envvar:`RANDOM_SEED` is not set.
      If both ``+ntb_random_seed`` and ``+seed`` are set, ``+ntb_random_seed`` is used.

.. make:var:: COCOTB_HDL_TIMEUNIT

      The default time unit that should be assumed for simulation when not specified by modules in the design.
      If this isn't specified then it is assumed to be ``1ns``.
      Allowed values are 1, 10, and 100.
      Allowed units are ``s``, ``ms``, ``us``, ``ns``, ``ps``, ``fs``.

      .. versionadded:: 1.3

.. make:var:: COCOTB_HDL_TIMEPRECISION

      The default time precision that should be assumed for simulation when not specified by modules in the design.
      If this isn't specified then it is assumed to be ``1ps``.
      Allowed values are 1, 10, and 100.
      Allowed units are ``s``, ``ms``, ``us``, ``ns``, ``ps``, ``fs``.

      .. versionadded:: 1.3

.. make:var:: CUSTOM_COMPILE_DEPS

      Use to add additional dependencies to the compilation target; useful for defining additional rules to run pre-compilation or if the compilation phase depends on files other than the RTL sources listed in :make:var:`VERILOG_SOURCES` or :make:var:`VHDL_SOURCES`.

.. make:var:: CUSTOM_SIM_DEPS

      Use to add additional dependencies to the simulation target.

.. make:var:: COCOTB_NVC_TRACE

      Set this to 1 to enable display of VHPI traces when using the NVC VHDL simulator.

.. make:var:: SIM_BUILD

      Use to define a scratch directory for use by the simulator. The path is relative to the Makefile location.
      If not provided, the default scratch directory is :file:`sim_build`.


Environment Variables
=====================

.. envvar:: TOPLEVEL

    Use this to indicate the instance in the hierarchy to use as the DUT.
    If this isn't defined then the first root instance is used.

.. envvar:: RANDOM_SEED

    Seed the Python random module to recreate a previous test stimulus.
    At the beginning of every test a message is displayed with the seed used for that execution:

    .. code-block:: bash

        INFO     cocotb.gpi                                  __init__.py:89   in _initialise_testbench           Seeding Python random module with 1377424946


    To recreate the same stimuli use the following:

    .. code-block:: bash

       make RANDOM_SEED=1377424946

    See also: :envvar:`PLUSARGS`

.. envvar:: COCOTB_ANSI_OUTPUT

    Use this to override the default behavior of annotating cocotb output with
    ANSI color codes if the output is a terminal (``isatty()``).

    ``COCOTB_ANSI_OUTPUT=1`` forces output to be ANSI regardless of the type of ``stdout``

    ``COCOTB_ANSI_OUTPUT=0`` suppresses the ANSI output in the log messages

.. envvar:: COCOTB_REDUCED_LOG_FMT

    If defined, log lines displayed in the terminal will be shorter. It will print only
    time, message type (``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR``, ...) and the log message itself.

.. envvar:: COCOTB_PDB_ON_EXCEPTION

   If defined, cocotb will drop into the Python debugger (:mod:`pdb`) if a test fails with an exception.

.. envvar:: MODULE

    The name of the module(s) to search for test functions.  Multiple modules can be specified using a comma-separated list.

.. envvar:: TESTCASE

    The name of the test function(s) to run.  If this variable is not defined cocotb
    discovers and executes all functions decorated with the :class:`cocotb.test` decorator in the supplied :envvar:`MODULE` list.

    Multiple test functions can be specified using a comma-separated list.

.. envvar:: COCOTB_RESULTS_FILE

    The file name where xUnit XML tests results are stored. If not provided, the default is :file:`results.xml`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3


Additional Environment Variables
--------------------------------

.. envvar:: COCOTB_ATTACH

    In order to give yourself time to attach a debugger to the simulator process before it starts to run,
    you can set the environment variable :envvar:`COCOTB_ATTACH` to a pause time value in seconds.
    If set, cocotb will print the process ID (PID) to attach to and wait the specified time before
    actually letting the simulator run.

.. envvar:: COCOTB_ENABLE_PROFILING

    Enable performance analysis of the Python portion of cocotb. When set, a file :file:`test_profile.pstat`
    will be written which contains statistics about the cumulative time spent in the functions.

    From this, a callgraph diagram can be generated with `gprof2dot <https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot>`_ and ``graphviz``.
    See the ``profile`` Make target in the ``endian_swapper`` example on how to set this up.

.. envvar:: COCOTB_HOOKS

    A comma-separated list of modules that should be executed before the first test.
    You can also use the :class:`cocotb.hook` decorator to mark a function to be run before test code.

.. envvar:: COCOTB_LOG_LEVEL

    The default logging level to use. This is set to ``INFO`` unless overridden.
    Valid values are ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, ``ERROR``, ``CRITICAL``.

.. envvar:: COCOTB_RESOLVE_X

    Defines how to resolve bits with a value of ``X``, ``Z``, ``U`` or ``W`` when being converted to integer.
    Valid settings are:

    ``VALUE_ERROR``
       raise a :exc:`ValueError` exception
    ``ZEROS``
       resolve to ``0``
    ``ONES``
       resolve to ``1``
    ``RANDOM``
       randomly resolve to a ``0`` or a ``1``

    Set to ``VALUE_ERROR`` by default.

.. envvar:: COCOTB_SCHEDULER_DEBUG

    Enable additional log output of the coroutine scheduler.

.. envvar:: COVERAGE

    Enable to report Python coverage data. For some simulators, this will also report HDL coverage.

    This needs the :mod:`coverage` Python module to be installed.

.. envvar:: MEMCHECK

    HTTP port to use for debugging Python's memory usage.
    When set to e.g. ``8088``, data will be presented at `<http://localhost:8088>`_.

    This needs the :mod:`cherrypy` and :mod:`dowser` Python modules installed.

.. envvar:: COCOTB_PY_DIR

    Path to the directory containing the cocotb Python package in the :file:`cocotb` subdirectory.
    You don't normally need to modify this.

.. envvar:: COCOTB_SHARE_DIR

    Path to the directory containing the cocotb Makefiles and simulator libraries in the subdirectories
    :file:`lib`, :file:`include`, and :file:`makefiles`.
    You don't normally need to modify this.
