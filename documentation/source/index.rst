***************
What is cocotb?
***************

**cocotb** is a *COroutine* based *COsimulation* *TestBench* environment for verifying VHDL and SystemVerilog :term:`RTL` using `Python <https://www.python.org>`_.

cocotb is completely free, open source (under the `BSD License <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#3-clause_license_(%22BSD_License_2.0%22,_%22Revised_BSD_License%22,_%22New_BSD_License%22,_or_%22Modified_BSD_License%22)>`_) and hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb>`_.

cocotb requires a simulator to simulate the :term:`HDL` design
and has been used with a variety of simulators on Linux, Windows and macOS.
Please check the :ref:`simulator-support` page for specifics.

A (possibly older) version of cocotb can be used live in a web browser on `EDA Playground <https://www.edaplayground.com>`_.


************************
How is cocotb different?
************************

cocotb encourages the same philosophy of design re-use and randomized testing as
`UVM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Verification_Methodology>`_,
however is implemented in Python.

With cocotb, VHDL or SystemVerilog are normally only used for the design itself, not the testbench.

cocotb has built-in support for integrating with continuous integration systems,
such as Jenkins, GitLab, etc. through standardized, machine-readable test reporting formats.

cocotb was specifically designed to lower the overhead of creating a test.

cocotb automatically discovers tests so that no additional step is required to add a test to a regression.

All verification is done using Python which has various advantages over using SystemVerilog or VHDL for verification:

* Writing Python is **fast** - it's a very productive language.
* It's **easy** to interface to other languages from Python.
* Python has a huge library of existing code to **re-use**.
* Python is **interpreted** - tests can be edited and re-run without having to recompile the design or exit the simulator GUI.
* Python is **popular** - far more engineers know Python than SystemVerilog or VHDL.


*********************
How does cocotb work?
*********************

A typical cocotb testbench requires no additional :term:`RTL` code.
The Design Under Test (:term:`DUT`) is instantiated as the toplevel in the simulator without any wrapper code.
cocotb drives stimulus onto the inputs to the :term:`DUT` (or further down the hierarchy) and monitors the outputs directly from Python.

A test is simply a Python function.
At any given time either the simulator is advancing time or the Python code is executing.
The :keyword:`await` keyword is used to indicate when to pass control of execution back to the simulator.
A test can spawn multiple coroutines, allowing for independent flows of execution.
