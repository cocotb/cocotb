class Clock:
    r"""Simple 50:50 duty cycle clock driver.

    Instances of this class should call its :meth:`start` method
    and pass the coroutine object to one of the functions in :ref:`task-management`.

    This will create a clocking task that drives the signal at the
    desired period/frequency.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        c = Clock(dut.clk, 10, "ns")
        await cocotb.start(c.start())

    Args:
        signal: The clock pin/signal to be driven.
        period: The clock period. Must convert to an even number of
            timesteps.
        units: One of
            ``'step'``, ``'fs'``, ``'ps'``, ``'ns'``, ``'us'``, ``'ms'``, ``'sec'``.
            When *units* is ``'step'``,
            the timestep is determined by the simulator (see :make:var:`COCOTB_HDL_TIMEPRECISION`).
        impl: One of
            ``'auto'``, ``'gpi'``, ``'py'``.
            Specify whether the clock is implemented with a :class:`~cocotb.simulator.GpiClock` (faster), or with a Python coroutine.
            When ``'auto'`` is used (default), the fastest implementation that supports your environment and use case is picked.

            .. versionadded:: 2.0

    When *impl* is ``'auto'``, if :envvar:`COCOTB_TRUST_INERTIAL_WRITES` is defined,
    the :class:`~cocotb.simulator.GpiClock` implementation will be used.
    Otherwise, the Python coroutine implementation will be used.
    See the environment variable documentation for more information on the consequences
    of using the simulator's inertial write mechanism.

    If you need more features like a phase shift and an asymmetric duty cycle,
    it is simple to create your own clock generator (that you then :func:`~cocotb.start`):

    .. code-block:: python

        async def custom_clock():
            # pre-construct triggers for performance
            high_time = Timer(high_delay, units="ns")
            low_time = Timer(low_delay, units="ns")
            await Timer(initial_delay, units="ns")
            while True:
                dut.clk.value = 1
                await high_time
                dut.clk.value = 0
                await low_time

    If you also want to change the timing during simulation,
    use this slightly more inefficient example instead where
    the :class:`Timer`\ s inside the while loop are created with
    current delay values:

    .. code-block:: python

        async def custom_clock():
            while True:
                dut.clk.value = 1
                await Timer(high_delay, units="ns")
                dut.clk.value = 0
                await Timer(low_delay, units="ns")


        high_delay = low_delay = 100
        await cocotb.start(custom_clock())
        await Timer(1000, units="ns")
        high_delay = low_delay = 10  # change the clock speed
        await Timer(1000, units="ns")

    .. versionchanged:: 1.5
        Support ``'step'`` as the *units* argument to mean "simulator time step".

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
        Passing ``None`` as the *units* argument was removed, use ``'step'`` instead.
