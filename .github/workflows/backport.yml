# A workflow to automatically backport pull requests to a stable branch.
#
# This workflow uses the Backport CLI (https://github.com/sorenlouv/backport)
# under the hood, which is configured in `.backportrc.json` in the repository
# root.
#
# See https://github.com/sorenlouv/backport-github-action for documentation
# on the used action.

      # Also update `branchLabelMapping` in `.backportrc.json` when changing the
      # label here.
      #
      # Implementation note: GitHub's contains() is matching the full string
      # when operating on an array (and startsWith() does not operate on arrays
      # at all). Do the label matching with jq instead.
