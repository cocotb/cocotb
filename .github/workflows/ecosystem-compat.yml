# Tests to ensure that projects depending on cocotb continue to work with the
# latest development version of cocotb.
#
# Generally, we test the development version of cocotb against supported,
# released versions of the other projects. (It is expected that the projects
# themselves test their in-development code against the released version of
# cocotb.)
