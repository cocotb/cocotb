# AXI master/slave

Test read/write axi master lite and read/write axi slave classes.


## Source Files

Sources are written in VHDL and simulator used is ghdl. Sources files initialy
generated by vivado, then modified to match 64bits master read/write.

* **axi_slave_master.vhd**: top file to connect slave and master axi interfaces
* **axi_slave_master_M00_AXI.vhd**: master interface that will read/write in
	64bits
* **axi_slave_master_S00_AXI.vhd**: slave interface in 32bits to access four
	axi registers

## Simulate

To simulate simply launch make in *axi_slave_master/* directory :

	$ cd axi_slave_master/cocotb/
	$ make

## Waves

It's possible to see waves with gtkwave :

	$ gtkwave sim_build/axi_slave_master.ghw
