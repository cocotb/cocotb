Added :class:`GpiClock`, a C++ implementation of a simple clock, exposed as :class:`~cocotb.simulator.GpiClock`. It has the advantage of higher performance due to not having to wake up a python task on a Timer to then enqueue a write. The existing :class:`~cocotb.clock.Clock` uses it automatically when it would behave identically to the python implementation.
