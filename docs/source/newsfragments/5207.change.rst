The ``LIBPYTHON_LOC`` environment variable was removed from the GPI. Instead, ``libpython`` should be included in :envvar:`GPI_USERS`. Support remains in Makefiles (:make:var:`LIBPYTHON_LOC`) and Python Runner (:envvar:`LIBPYTHON_LOC`) for backwards-compatibility. In this case the value of :envvar:`!LIBPYTHON_LOC` is included in the generated :envvar:`!GPI_USERS` if and only if :envvar:`!GPI_USERS` is not already defined.
