``cocotb.handle.ConstantObject`` was removed. Constant value objects are now returned as their corresponding :class:`simulator value object <cocotb.handle.ValueObjectBase>` subtype (e.g. integers in VHDL and Verilog are now :class:`~cocotb.handle.IntegerObject`\ s). You can check if the value object is constant using the :meth:`~cocotb.handle.ValueObjectBase.is_const` method.
