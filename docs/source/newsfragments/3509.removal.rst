Support for generator-based coroutines, which used the ``cocotb.coroutine`` decorator and :keyword:`yield` syntax, has been removed. To update to the new syntax, remove all uses of the decorator and convert the function to a :term:`coroutine function` using the :keyword:`async` and :keyword:`await` syntax.
