Add a new compilation flow for Questa called ``qisqrun``. This flow uses uses the Questa Information System (QIS) for faster simulation performance, Qrun for automatic ordering of VHDL source files and Visualizer as GUI. The new flow can be enabled explicitly by passing :make:var:`SIM=questa-qisqrun <SIM>` to ``make``. Users using ``SIM=questa`` use the flow automatically if Questa 2025.2 or newer is detected. To explicitly choose the older flow (which uses ``vsim`` and friends) use ``SIM=questa-compat``.
