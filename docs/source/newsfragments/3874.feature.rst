Upon :meth:`cancellation <cocotb.task.Task.cancel>` of a :class:`~cocotb.task.Task`, a :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError` is thrown into the Task where it is currently ``await``\ ing. This allows the user to catch the :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError`, use :keyword:`finally` statements, or use :term:`context managers` to perform cleanup when the Task is cancelled. This includes when Tasks are cancelled at the end of the Test.
