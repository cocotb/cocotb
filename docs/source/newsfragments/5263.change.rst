Changed input value checking on :class:`~cocotb.handle.IntegerObject` and :class:`~cocotb.handle.EnumObject` to reflect the size and signedness of the underlying HDL type. Previously, both classes would accept negative values even if the underlying type was unsigned, and had a hardcoded and incorrect limit on the size of the value size that didn't reflect the size of the underlying HDL type.
