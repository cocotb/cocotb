Improved VHPI implementation of :func:`cocotb.simulator.get_root_handle`. The ``name`` parameter is now used for handle lookup only as the last fallback, after checking it against the name of the ``vhpiRootInst`` object and its associated ``entity`` object. Handle lookup by name now always includes the ``:`` prefix so that it matches the ``FullName`` of the instantiated object, and will not match objects in the library information model.
