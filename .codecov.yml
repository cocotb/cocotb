        # doesn't work for our CI setup, causing early reports to come in which
        # indicate a drop in coverage. These reports are later updated as more
        # reports come in. But by that time the first issue comment has already
        # been made and an email has been sent. Prevent that by explicitly
        # specifying the number of builds that need to be uploaded to codecov

        # Keep this number in sync with the CI configuration!
